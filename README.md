##ðŸ’€ HTML Game: Pain Edition
I wrote this during an internet blackout in Iran because I was bored out of my mind.

##ðŸŽ® About the Game
It's a ðŸ’» game, You use the arrow keys to move between falling blocks and reach the top.
But when you finally make itâ€¦ the game resets.
Except now, the distance to the top is longer than before â€”
psychological warfare
